//  Why so much static? I only want one connection to each device.
//  There isn't even a good reason for a client to have access
//  to an individual instance, just need the most simple way to send a
//  message based on an led strip number.
//
//  Why not use a vector then if its going to be index-based messaging?
//  We need a more complex data structure to map LED strips to controllers
//  Maybe could've just used a map, but at the very least this is an
//  exercise. I'm also not sure that would store enough info because before
//  sending the fill message the "strip" field needs to be replaced with
//  the strip's on device index, so simple knowing the LEDStrip to controller
//  mapping isn't enough.
